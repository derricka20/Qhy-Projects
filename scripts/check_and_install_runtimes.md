Updated Python script that not only checks for the presence of required runtimes but also attempts to auto-install any missing ones using common package managers (like `apt`, `brew`, or `choco`) based on the operating system.

### Updated Python Script: Check and Install Runtimes

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import platform

def run_command(command):
    """Run a shell command and return the result."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(
            command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True, shell=True
        )
        return result.returncode == 0, result.stdout.strip() or result.stderr.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return False, str(e)

def check_runtime(name, check_command, install_command=None):
    """Check if a runtime is installed, and if not, optionally install it."""
    print(f"Checking {name}...")
    is_installed, output = run_command(check_command)
    
    if is_installed:
        print(f"{name} is installed: {output}")
    else:
        print(f"{name} is NOT installed.")
        if install_command:
            print(f"Attempting to install {name}...")
            success, install_output = run_command(install_command)
            if success:
                print(f"{name} installed successfully!")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to install {name}. Error: {install_output}")
        else:
            print(f"Auto-installation for {name} is not supported on this OS.")

def main():
    print("Checking runtime environments...\n")

    # Detect the operating system
    os_name = platform.system()
    print(f"Detected OS: {os_name}")

    # Define the commands based on the OS
    if os_name == "Linux":
        runtimes = [
            ("Python", "python3 --version", "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3"),
            (".NET SDK", "dotnet --version", "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-6.0"),
            ("Lua", "lua -v", "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y lua5.4"),
            ("Perl", "perl -v", "sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y perl"),
        ]
    elif os_name == "Darwin":  # macOS
        runtimes = [
            ("Python", "python3 --version", "brew install python3"),
            (".NET SDK", "dotnet --version", "brew install --cask dotnet-sdk"),
            ("Lua", "lua -v", "brew install lua"),
            ("Perl", "perl -v", "brew install perl"),
        ]
    elif os_name == "Windows":
        runtimes = [
            ("Python", "python --version", "choco install python"),
            (".NET SDK", "dotnet --version", "choco install dotnet-sdk"),
            ("Lua", "lua -v", "choco install lua"),
            ("Perl", "perl -v", "choco install strawberryperl"),
        ]
    else:
        print(f"Unsupported operating system: {os_name}")
        return

    # Check and install runtimes
    for name, check_cmd, install_cmd in runtimes:
        check_runtime(name, check_cmd, install_cmd)

    print("\nCheck complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Features:
1. **Detects the Operating System**:
   - Automatically determines whether the OS is Linux, macOS, or Windows using the `platform` module.

2. **Custom Commands per OS**:
   - For Linux: Uses `apt` for installation.
   - For macOS: Uses `brew` (Homebrew) for installation.
   - For Windows: Uses `choco` (Chocolatey) for installation.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Prints detailed error messages if the installation fails.

4. **Expandable**:
   - You can easily add more runtimes or adapt the install commands for your specific package manager.

---

### How to Use:
1. Save the script as `check_and_install_runtimes.py` in your `scripts` folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python check_and_install_runtimes.py
   ```
3. The script will check if Python, .NET SDK, Lua, and Perl are installed. If any runtime is missing, it will attempt to install it automatically.

---

### Important Notes:
- **Administrative Privileges**:
  - On Linux and macOS, the script uses `sudo` for package installation. Ensure that you have sudo privileges.
  - On Windows, you need to run the script in a terminal with administrator privileges for `choco` to work.

- **Package Managers**:
  - Ensure that `brew` is installed on macOS and `choco` is installed on Windows. You can find installation instructions for these tools:
    - Homebrew: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
    - Chocolatey: [https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/)

This script simplifies the process of ensuring runtime environments are ready for your project.ðŸš€
